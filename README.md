# Nix Hour Transcripts

This repository contains transcripts of **Nix Hour**, a series of sessions by 
[Tweag](https://www.tweag.io/) presented by **Silvan Mosberger**. The sessions 
provide deep insights into the Nix and NixOS ecosystem.

The goal is to make the knowledge from these sessions more accessible and easier 
to reference for the community.

## Current Progress

Below are the transcripts completed or in progress:

- **0th**: Informal introduction to Nix language, derivations and nixpkgs (Finished)
- **2nd**: Overriding derivations, fixed-output derivations, sharing closures
- **3rd**: Flake updating, nix edit and some corners of the nix language
- **4th**: Comparing flakes to traditional nix (Finished)
