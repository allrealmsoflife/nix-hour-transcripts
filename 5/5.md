Silvan: Yeah, so since you asked this just before Simonas do you want to repeat the question?

Question: Yeah, I can repeat it, so what I've been doing, like I've been trying to play a Valorian
game, like the Rust open source game, and the launcher is running on 0.7 and I thought I will just
override it to 0.9, make a derivation and then as I started doing the derivation I came across this
problem with cargo sha256 that I did not know how to calculate it out.

Silvan: Yeah, so the question is how to update rust packages to, how to override rust packages with
newer versions well, yeah I guess that's the question, and then there's the problem of the dependency
hash not being updated automatically.

Simonas: Yeah, so making a derivation carg sha256 needs to be additionally also kind of like recalculated

Silvan: Yeah, which package did you try it on

Simonas: airshipper

Silvan: OK

```nix
nix-instantiate -A airshipper.version
error: expression does not evaluate to a derivation (or a set or list of those)
```

Okay, so do you want to use, let's use:

```nix
ne -A airshipper.version
"0.7.0"
```

And you wanted to get a newer version?

Simonas: 0.9.0

Silvan: Yeah, okay, let's I guess try it out there so, let's try to write an overlay, I'm just gonna write this
locally in my nixpkgs here:

```bash
vim overlay.nix
```
So `self: super: { }` we could also use alternative, the others are `final:` and `prev:`, it's really kind of just
convention, you can name them anything you want, then `airshipper = `, so by default usually you do something like 
this, `super.airshipper`, and then `.overrideAttrs`, because you want to override the src attribute and that's part
of the derivation attributes, so that's what `overrideAttrs` overrides. Then we get in here the `(old: ` attributes
from the derivation and can provide new ones, so here we say `src = `, well now got to figure out how it gets fetched:

```nix
# final: prev:
self: super: {
  airshipper = super.airshipper.overrideAttrs (old: {
    src =
  });
}
```

Let me go into nixpkgs here, (`~/src/nixpkgs`), go to airshipper, look at how that's packaged, we see `src = fetchFromGitLab`,
okay, that looks good, we go back here and just copy that in:

```nix
self: super: {
  airshipper = super.airshipper.overrideAttrs (old: {
    src = fetchFromGitLab {
        owner = "Veloren";
        repo = "airshipper";
        rev = "v${version}";
        hash = "sha256-V8G1mZIdqf+WGcrUzRgWnlUk+EXs4arAEQdRESpobGg=";
    };
  });
}
```

Let me do, `0.9.0`, and I guess we can also do this here version, well let's put the version here, and I think if we 
don't update the name here it will keep the same derivation name, let's see what happens, and here we need to use
`rec` I believe, we talked about this in a previous video where there is a new convention in nixpkgs which doesn't
require the `rec` anymore, the video there was a bit misleading because most derivations don't use the new convention
yet so in most cases this is still needed so `old.version` would still be 0.7.0 here, not the 0.9.0, so for now
I'm just gonna use the old convention with `rec` and then the `sha` we need to update it a bit, so it causes a refetch,
let me just change a character here, we can also clear it, yeah let's do that.

Julien Debon: Or you can use an empty string right?

Silvan: Um, yeah, I wonder if just not specifying also works, if that's the same as an empty string, I guess we can try 
it out here:

```nix
self: super: {
  airshipper = super.airshipper.overrideAttrs (old: rec {
    version = "0.9.0";
    src = fetchFromGitLab {
        owner = "Veloren";
        repo = "airshipper";
        rev = "v${version}";
        # hash = "sha256-V8G1mZIdqf+WGcrUzRgWnlUk+EXs4arAEQdRESpobGg=";
    };
  });
}
```

Viktor Kleen: What I usually do, is I say `sha256` is `self.lib.fakehash`

Silvan: Yeah that, I think nowadays that's not really required anymore because just an empty sha also works, this is a 
somewhat recent feature in nix as far as I know, and the `lib.` what is, `lib.fakeSha256`, I think that was introduced
before nix allowed empty sha's.

Viktor Kleen: You can also do the fakehash, fakehash is just the new, the sri hash string.

Silvan: I see, nice. Yeah, let's try to do that for now, I'm gonna try to do the build here:

```bash
:!nix-build -A airshipper
```

And it works, so apparently this didn't work at all, is it because I didn't provide a hash here? Or is it cargo sha 256, oh
it is because we haven't applied the overlay, I just wrote it in my local directory here. So I'm using the old CLI here,
we are in a nixpkgs checkout, you can build packages like this (`nix-build -A airshipper`), but this doesn't apply the
overlay automatically. We could move the overlay to:

```bash
mv overlay.nix ~/.config/nixpkgs/overlays/airshipper.nix
```

We need to create the directory first, `mkdir ~/.config/nixpkgs/overlays -p`, move it in there, so this is impure,
I see Yuri mentions in the chat so this is impure, so flakes doesn't work with this. Flakes would just ignore this.
I'm gonna show this without relying on this in a second

```nix
nix-build -A airshipper
error: undefined variable 'fetchFromGitLab`
```

Okay, we get an error because I made a mistake in the file but it gets evaluated, so let's fix it here, we need to use:

```nix
self: super: {
  airshipper = super.airshipper.overrideAttrs (old: {
    src = self.fetchFromGitLab {
        owner = "Veloren";
        repo = "airshipper";
        rev = "v${version}";
        sha256 = "";
    };
  });
}
```

Let's try to evaluate it again:

```nix
nix-build -A airshipper
warning: found empty hash, assuming 'sha256-AA..='
```

And okay, we can see it inferred from the empty hash, and did we provide one? We did provide one, we also want to see if
it works without any hash at all, (`# sha256 ="";`), yeah that also works, okay that's good news. You do need to watch out
a bit if you use `fetchTarball` without the hash, so this a builtin fetcher, (`builtin.fetchTarball {}`), and we could
also try this out here so let's say `src = fetchTarball {};` and then we use 
```nix
url = "https://github.com/Veloren/airshipper/archive/v0.9.0.tar.gz";
```

Julien Debon: I think it's gitlab not github.

Silvan: Oh it's gitlab all right.

Simone Narbutas: It's mirrored though.

Silvan: It does turn into the same url?

Simone Narbuta: It should be the same on github, like as far as I know

Silvan: Okay, let's try this then

```nix
self: super: {
  airshipper = super.airshipper.overrideAttrs (old: rec {
    version = "0.9.0";
    # src = self.fetchFromGitLab {
    #    owner = "Veloren";
    #    repo = "airshipper";
    #    rev = "v${version}";
    #    sha256 = "";
    #};
    src = fetchTarball {
      url = "https://gitlab.com/Veloren/airshipper/archive/v0.9.0.tar.gz";
    };
  });
}
```
