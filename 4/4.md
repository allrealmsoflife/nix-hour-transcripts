Silvan: All right, so just repeating the question about, you might be able to get Nix into your company,
but you aren't sure about the whole flakes situation, and it being labeled as experimental stuff,
and just kind of some clarification about that, what the best practice would be and if it's a 
good idea to get into Nix now, does that sound about accurate?

Q: Yeah basically when I look at documentation there is two different approaches fundamentally,
and I don't know really if I can propose, "hey we can use that for our project, but it's experimental",
it just seems a little bit crazy to do that. 

Silvan: Yeah, yeah, so personally what I would go for is to hold off flakes just for the time being.
Maybe I can, do we have anything good to look at, mhm, maybe the, let me share my browser window here,
so flakes is in the process of, there is some effort to stabilize it, we can maybe go into, here
RFC's 127, no it's not this one, this one, RFC number 136. This is an RFC that lays out kind of first
steps towards stabilizing flakes and so that's currently going on. Just recently the Nix team has been
founded, there is weekly events I think on discourse, they are publishing meeting notes, the Nix team,
Nix team creation yeah, https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nix-team-creation/22228.

So the Nix team has been created recently to kind of distribute the Nix development process a bit, so
the Nix repositories is where all of the flake magic currently is and currently marked as experimental,
and up to recently Eelco Dolstra, the inventor of, or creator of Nix was pretty much the main person to
do this development, to do the merges and pull request reviews and he kind of gave the direction of Nix.
And that's also kind of how flakes came to be, but recently because this was deemed not super stable,
or not super sustainable, the Nix team has been created to kind of have more than one person do this flow
and make sure Nix can progress and there's a good vision and stuff like that.

Also recently, this kind of all happened at the same I'd say, at NixCon, there was a lot of talk about, uh
well a lot of people met and a lot of things have been discussed, and I don't think a lot of flake discussions
have been had, it most mostly kind of an avoided topic, it's definetly the elephant in the room currently,
in the nix community, but what should we do about that. So I'm optimistic that in let's say in the next
year, either, yeah in the next year I'd say flakes can get stabilized. How it's gonna get stabilized, I'm
not sure, it might stay the way it is right now which I think it's problematic for some reasons, or 
it might change in backwards incompatible ways, and because we don't know I would not recommend adopting
flakes at the moment. Only, not like on a large scale at least. If you want to try out flakes because it is
an experimental feature that might be cool to try out but I wouldn't recommend building it into the stable
workflow of everyday developers. Just, well, of course I am a bit biased, flakes does provide a lot of benefit
that is a bit harder to get in standard nix or traditional nix, say, but there are a lot of things, there are,
flakes does provide a lot of utility but you can also get some of that in standard nix if you adopt some
conventions and stuff. So I think I'll go now into some, into showing a bit about how I think flakes, a lot
of features of flakes can be gotten regardless without flakes, so you can still use stable nix without depending
on flakes. Does that sound good or are there any questions about things I've just said?

Q: No, that be very helpful yeah.

Silvan: All right, let me share this then

```bash
cd nix-hour
mkdir flakes
cd flakes
vim flake.nix
```
One of the main things flakes gets you is the pure evaluation. So let's say we have a `flake.nix` file, we
have a simple, let's say `outputs` equal `self`, then let's also take `nixpkgs`, we just then, let's do,
let's say `foo` equals, say `import` nixpkgs, and then let's go, well let's not do anything for now, let's just
do this and see what happens.

```nix
{

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs }: {
    foo = import nixpkgs {};
  };
}
````
So let's say `myHello`, let's call it like that, `myHello = (import nixpkgs {}).hello;`, so let's say you have
a very simple flake here, you import nix packages and now we need to call `:!nix flake lock` I believe, oh actually,
it totally crashed actually, did it? No, it just was very slow. Let's do `git init` here because flakes relies on
git repositories, let's add all the files here, `gaa`, and now we should be able to `nix flake show`, all right,
so it did create a lock file automatically locking the nix packages I believe (checks the .lock file). Now, let's
try the `nix build .#myHello`, and so now we get this error (`error: attribute 'currentSystem' missing`), and 
this is going to be when you use flake you see a lot of these errors unless you, well, not a lot, it's fairly easy
to get around it but this is the pure evaluation of flakes that if you use flakes, nix enforces a pure evaluation
of your nix code. This means there is no access to `builtins.currentSystem` which we see here:

```nix
nix-repl> builtins.currentSystems
"x86_64-linux"
```
Current system is different on whatever system you evaluated on. If I were on darwin it would be a different
string here so this is why it's impure, the same expression leads to different results on different systems
and environments. Similarly there is `builtins.getEnv "USER"` which allows you to get the environment variables
in nix which is of course impure because it depends on the environment and there's a bunch of others like this.

And flakes enables pure evaluation mode by default, uh yeah, so this is impossible, there is a way to get around
this but this is discouraged of course, there is `--impure`, this then works, `nix build .#myHello --impure`.
But yeah, to fix it in flakes you have to explicitly pass the system in this case, system equals then let's say,
in here, then we can't use `builtins.currentSystem` because of course that's impure, that's also the default and so
if I pass the system here it does work, oh let's do impure and it also works:

```nix
{

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs }: {
    myHello = (import nixpkgs {
      system = "x86_64-linux";
    }).hello;
  };

}
````

```bash
nix build .#myHello --impure
warning: ... is dirty

nix build .#myHello 
warning: ... is dirty
```
Now let's just check Hello:

```bash
> result/bin/hello
Hello, world!
```

So ok, now let's look at how this would look at in a `default.nix`, so let's try to do the very same thing, so we have
the locked nix packages in here (in lock file), we have the and we build the myHello package which is just the hello
from nixpkgs. To do this, oh let's actually do first, make this agnostic over the system because this a bit, usually we
have an output schema which is like this, and now flake utils would probably be good, let's just put up the output schema
right here and do it like this, so this is not the best practice in flakes but, let's do like this:

```nix
{

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs }: {
    packages.x86_64-linux.myHello = (import nixpkgs {system = "x86_64-linux"; }).hello;
    packages.x86_64-darwin.myHello = (import nixpkgs {system = "x86_64-darwin"; }).hello;
  };
  
}
```
So you can also use flake-utils for this, that is a third party community project that does this for all the systems,
so simplifies the setup for that, typically recommended yeah, but let's now do the same with standard nix, `vim default.nix`,
traditional nix, so first of all we might do, so we can do it very easily like this, `(import <nixpkgs>{}).hello` and let's also 
do `myHello`, this is an attribute set:

```nix
{
  myHello = (import <nixpkgs> {}).hello;
}
```

OK, this does work, now let me evaluate that, `:!nix-build -A myHello` and that works. And so this, but this is impure,
we also want the same purity of standard flakes, here we have a couple impurities, we have the nix packages from this,
`<nixpkgs>`, if we evaluate this in a nix repl:

```nix
> nix repl
nix-repl> <nixpkgs>
/nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/root/channels/nixos
```

We can see this points to some channel, and this is different then this path for every user and this path changes when I
update the channels and stuff, and so this is an impurity, we want to get rid of this. The way we can do this is by
simply saying, let's add a `let in`, let's say nixpkgs is equal to, now we can say `fetchTarball {};`, so `fetchTarball`
is a builtin function that can fetch a tarball, in this case we can say we fetch from github.com, NixOS, nixpkgs,
then github provides archives, archives of the repositories at specific commits, we just need the revision here,
and the revision let's get it from the lock file, let's go into `flake.lock`, let's copy the same one it uses here,
`d01cb...tar.gz";`, then we provide the hash, as you can already see this is already a bit annoying to do here, in 
flakes we don't have to do any of that but we can get rid of this (`<nixpkgs>`) impurity now, so now let's evaluate this again:

```nix
let
  nixpkgs = fetchTarball {
    url = "https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/d01cb...tar.gz";
    sha256 = "000...0";
  };
in {
  myHello = (import nixpkgs {}).hello;
}
```

Let's do a `nix-build -A myHello` again, and it's gonna take a bit longer, it's going to fetch this tarball, it's gonna
try to verify that the hash is correct, and I'm kind of surprised that it doesn't reuse the result from flakes but I,
maybe that's a different cache, ah so we get the hash back (`error mismatch in file..`), let's insert this here and now 
we can build it again, and this should be the exact same result as flakes, let's try this, this now points to, (compares 
both `result -> nix/store/jidy..hello-2.12.1`.

All right, we also have another impurity, the same we had in flakes earlier, that's the system and there is actually some
more. So nix packages has kind of three main arguments that most people care about, that's `overlays`, `config`, and `system`,
the one we saw earlier, and all of these have defaults that are impure, `overlays` by default reads from `~/.config/nixpkgs/overlays`
I believe, `config` by default reads from `~/.config/nixpkgs/config.nix` and `system` by default is `builtins.currentSystem`,
so these are pretty bad here, these are like, like I've seen users have problems because they didn't realize the defaults were
pulled in, and they had some `overlays` in `config.nix` that was custom to their setup, and therefore breaking some 
development workflow for a project. Same in flakes can't happen because it enforces this.

```nix
myHello = (import nixpkgs {
  # overlays, by default ~/.config/nixpkgs/overlays
  # config, by default ~/.config/nixpkgs/config.nix
  # system, by default builtins.currentSystem
```

In non-flakes we can also do this just by overriding these with empty values, you can say overlays is empty, config is empty,
overlays is a list, so we can pass an empty list, `overlays = [];`, config is I guess attribute sets so we pass an empty attribute
set, `config = {};`, and system, now we don't want to do this here, `"x86_64-linux"`, because, well the `builtins.currentSystem`
impurity is OK, it's typically what users expect and so we don't really want to make that more annoying to do, so we want to
leave this here, but we also want this expression to be, like we want to be able to change the system even if we are on a 
different one, so what typically is done is that we have a system argument to the top level function which defaults to 
`builtins.currentSystem and then in the result here or in the nix packages import we just use inherit system or system equals 
system and so this expression is a pure one but it has this impure default up here:

```nix
{ system ? builtins.currentSystem }:
let
  nixpkgs = fetchTarball {
    url = "https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/d01cb...tar.gz";
    sha256 = "000...0";
  };
in {
  myHello = (import nixpkgs
    # overlays, by default ~/.config/nixpkgs/overlays
    # config, by default ~/.config/nixpkgs/config.nix
    # system, by default builtins.currentSystem
    overlays = [];
    config = {};
    inherit system;
  }).hello;
}
```

But we can override this one, and the way we can override it is, well if we import this file from somewhere else,
say `import ./default.nix { system = "x86_64-darwin"; }`, or the CLI we can do let's try this `nix-build -A myHello`
so this still works and we can pass our string here as even with autocompletion, will pass another system,
`nix-build -A myHello --argstr system x86_64-darwin`, now this actually might, yeah this works because I have a,
cache.nixos.org has it cached, we can also try to build it by adding a check, `nix-build -A myHello --argstr system x86_64-darwin --check`
this only works if you already have the path in your store and why it's called check, so it builds it again and then
checks whether it results in the same path, the same binary. This will fail because I'm not on a darwin system, (building),
any second.. yep (fails), but yeah if you had remote builders this could also work.

Yeah, so this, as far as I know, does not have any impurities, and so this doesn't work super well at the moment,
I hope it improves a bit. You can also use pure evaluation mode in the old nix commands. So there is two flags,
one of them is `--pure` and one of them is `--pure-eval`, the `--pure-eval` one is for pure evaluation mode, the 
`--pure` is for nix shell, and this is, it is a bit misleading, `> nix-shell --pure`, it just doesn't propagate
your environment into the nix shell from outside but yeah in this case we want to use `--pure-eval`, 
`nix-build -A myHello --pure-eval`, and we get the problem here:

```nix
> nix-build -A myHello --pure-eval
error: access to absolute path '/home/tweagsy..default.nix' is forbidden in pure eval mode (use '--impure' to override)
```
Pure evaluation is so strict that you cannot even access the `default.nix` file which is evaluated by default so what
can we do? Can we pass the `default.nix` here, `nix-build -A myHello --pure-eval default.nix`, no, that also doesn't
work, the only way to make pure eval work is by giving an expression, so `--expr` short for expression and then here
now we can evaluate things in pure evaluation mode `'1 + 1'`, let's also remove the `-A` here, let's just do
`nix-instantiate --eval --pure-eval --expr '1 + 1'` (outputs 2). So this works, this in here is now pure evaluation,
so we can try to access `builtins.currentSystems` and it doesn't work, `nix-instantiate --eval --pure-eval --expr 'builtins.currentSystem'`,
the attribute doesn't exist, that's the same behaviour as in flakes, so here the only way to actually get access to 
any code and to import nix is by using builtin fetchers, and so what we can do here is we can use `builtins.fetchGit`, or
doesn't need the prefix, we can say `url` equals now dot slash dot I believe that should work, if we just try this:

```nix
nix-instantiate --eval --pure-eval --expr 'fetchGit { url = ./.; }'
error: in pure evaluation mode, 'fetchTree' requires locked input, at (string):1:1
```

It says, requires a locked input, so we need to provide a revision so now, the problem, we haven't commited our code yet, so
let's try this:

```bash
gst
gaa
rm result
git reset
gaa
gst
```

Let's commit these files and let's try this again:

```bash
nix-instantiate --eval --pure-eval --expr 'fetchGit { url = ./.; }'
git log
commit 6bb6.. (HEAD -> main) 
```

(Copies the commit hash) Now let's try this again:

```nix
nix-instantiate --eval --pure-eval --expr 'fetchGit { url = ./.; rev = "6bb6.."; }'

```

And so yeah, this works now, we have a something representing our source, we have an outpath which is where source
