Silvan: All right, so just repeating the question about, you might be able to get Nix into your company,
but you aren't sure about the whole flakes situation, and it being labeled as experimental stuff,
and just kind of some clarification about that, what the best practice would be and if it's a 
good idea to get into Nix now, does that sound about accurate?

Q: Yeah basically when I look at documentation there is two different approaches fundamentally,
and I don't know really if I can propose, "hey we can use that for our project, but it's experimental",
it just seems a little bit crazy to do that. 

Silvan: Yeah, yeah, so personally what I would go for is to hold off flakes just for the time being.
Maybe I can, do we have anything good to look at, mhm, maybe the, let me share my browser window here,
so flakes is in the process of, there is some effort to stabilize it, we can maybe go into, here
RFC's 127, no it's not this one, this one, RFC number 136. This is an RFC that lays out kind of first
steps towards stabilizing flakes and so that's currently going on. Just recently the Nix team has been
founded, there is weekly events I think on discourse, they are publishing meeting notes, the Nix team,
Nix team creation yeah, https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nix-team-creation/22228.

So the Nix team has been created recently to kind of distribute the Nix development process a bit, so
the Nix repositories is where all of the flake magic currently is and currently marked as experimental,
and up to recently Eelco Dolstra, the inventor of, or creator of Nix was pretty much the main person to
do this development, to do the merges and pull request reviews and he kind of gave the direction of Nix.
And that's also kind of how flakes came to be, but recently because this was deemed not super stable,
or not super sustainable, the Nix team has been created to kind of have more than one person do this flow
and make sure Nix can progress and there's a good vision and stuff like that.

Also recently, this kind of all happened at the same I'd say, at NixCon, there was a lot of talk about, uh
well a lot of people met and a lot of things have been discussed, and I don't think a lot of flake discussions
have been had, it most mostly kind of an avoided topic, it's definetly the elephant 03.25
