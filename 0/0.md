All right, well let's start super basically, I'm gonna use vim and editing the `default.nix` file, that's the file
nix evaluates by default, so let's open the file and some super basic nix stuff, let's just do like a null,
simplest value:

```nix
null
```

And then I can evaluate this, using, so there's an old way to evaluate things and a new way to evaluate things, the
old way to just evaluate the nix values is kind of convoluted, it's `nix-instantiate --eval`, ideally it should just
be `nix-eval` but legacy, `nix-instantiate --eval` and that should be it (returns `null`). Yes, so it evaluated `null`.
That's the `default.nix` file, we can also pass the file name explicitly: `nix-instantiate --eval default.nix` and 
that also works. Generally you don't have to use `nix-instantiate --eval` because in here you have like a derivation
or something, generally with nix you wanna build derivations instead of just evaluating nix itself, but yeah, let's
start with evaluation for now. 

So you have simple values, one of the main data structures in nix is the attribute set, lets add names here:

```nix
# Attribute set
{

}
```

That's just a dictionary known from almost every language out there you can have keys and values `foo = values;`, 
keys don't have to be quoted like json, there is an equal sign and a semicolon at the end. You can quote keys
as well, `"foo" = values;`, that isn't needed when you have special symbols in here for example like a dot,
`"foo.bar"` so we can evaluate this

```nix
# Attribute set
{
    foo = null;
    "foo.bar" = null;
}
```

```nix
:!nix-instantiate --eval default.nix
{ foo = null; "foo.bar" = null; }
```

This evaluates to this what you see, but if we were to use this literally like this: `foo.bar = null;` this would
nested in another set, so this is, what is it, `# syntactic sugar for:` foo equals another attribute set:

```nix
# Attribute set
{
    foo = null;
    "foo.bar" = null;

    foo.bar = null;
    # syntactic sugar for:
    foo = {
      bar = null;
    };
}
```

So it just nests it automatically for you, let's quote this out for now so that we don't get like conflict:

```nix
# Attribute set
{
    foo = null;
    "foo.bar" = null;

    foo.bar = null;
    # syntactic sugar for:
    # foo = {
    #   bar = null;
    # };
}
```

(returns error). Oh I declared `foo` here already, so maybe that's good to see:

```nix
:!nix-instantiate --eval default.nix
error: attribute 'foo.bar' already defined at /home/infinisil/test/nix-tutorial/default.nix:3:3..
```

Foo.. OK, that's an error in nix, geez. It's starting out well (smiles). So apparently it says `foo.bar` is already defined,
but then it points to, wait..

Matthew Healy: Is it because of the string one at line 4 or?

Silvan: I don't think it should be those, it should be different, I can come to that and see, yeah now, so apparently,
that is really conflict because if we syntacticly desugar this, I guess it does make sense, you have one foo null,
and one for the attribute set, all right, so I think it was just like an error in the error message but yeah it's 
conflict, you can only define an attribute once and so that is sometimes a bit tricky to see, sometimes you have 
like a big nix file and you do like `foo.bar` somewhere and then at a later time something else with `foo =`, but
yeah, let's continue on.

We can, some other values, integers, we also can do operations with integers like addition, `int = 10 + 10;`,
division, `int = 10 + 2 / 3`, subtraction, `int = 10 + 2 / 3 - 10;`. Integer division (`/`), is like, it doesn't use
floats, this (`2 / 3`) would get zero here. And here we are coming into lazy evaluation for the first time:

```nix
# Attribute set
{
    foo = null;
    "foo.bar" = null;

    fooz.bar = null;

    int = 10 + 2 / 3 - 10;
}
```

```nix
:!nix-instantiate --eval default.nix
{ foo = null; "foo.bar" = null; fooz = <CODE>; int = <CODE>; }
```

So if we just do the `nix-instantiate --eval` it shows like a `<CODE>` here which means that it hasn't evaluated this
fully. This is a bit of a detail to how it is implemented but we can just add a `--strict` here `nix-instantiate --eval --strict`
to force it to evaluate the whole thing, so then you can see the full values here:

```nix
:!nix-instantiate --eval --strict
{ foo = null; "foo.bar" = null; fooz = { bar = null; }; int = 0; }
```

There is also floats, floats aren't often used, `floats = 10 + 2 / 3 - 10;` 
but if you just add a, like a dot, `10.0`, like it converts the whole
expression to a floating thing:

```nix
:!nix-instantiate --eval --strict
{ floats = 0; foo = null; "foo.bar" = null; fooz = { bar = null; }; int = 0; }
```

Or, this part, `2.0`, I think you need here as well, like if there is at least one floating operation in the
pipeline it turns it into a float:

```nix
:!nix-instantiate --eval --strict 
{ floats = 0.666667; foo = null; "foo.bar" = null; fooz = { bar = null; }; int = 0; }
```

All right, there is a weird thing going on where it only prints the first six digits, `0.666667`, which is
often times a bit inaqurate, but, something to fix in nix. Then some other, what do we have, we have
floats, we have strings of course:

```nix
str = "foo bar";
```

Then strings can have interpolation. Certainly we need variables for this group so let's look at variables.
So variables, we can do a let in statement to declare variables so we can say, let `someVariable = 10;` 
in then the expression we want to evaluate with that variable in scope and we can say
`someVariable + 1;`

```nix
variables = 
  let someVariable = 10;
  in someVariable + 1;
```

Let's evaluate this:

```nix
:!nix-instantiate --eval --strict
{ floats = 0.666667; foo = null; "foo.bar" = null; fooz = { bar = null; }; int = 0; str = "foo bar";
variables = 11; }
```

It works. Let's get down a bit here. So with variables we can then also use interpolation. We'd say let
`someVariable = 10` or we need generally a, actually you don't need variables for interpolation I'm just
realizing but let's use like this for now so we can have some string, or let's say `someName = Silvan`,
in `"Hello, ${someName}";`:

```nix
interpolation = 
  let someName = "Silvan";
  in "Hello, ${someName}";
```

So this is how interpolation looks like in nix, the dollar, curly brackets, then in here, `{}`, you can
also do, like this is a general nix expression, you can put anything here, you can also add like a plus,
`{someName + }`, by the way plus is also for string concatenation, Silvan, let's add my last name here,
`${someName + " Mosberger"}";`, so you can do this, the quotes do get a bit confusing here, but the
string addition here, this is the same as just, moving Mosberger out here like this:

```nix
interpolation = 
  let someName = "Silvan";
  in "Hello, ${ someName + " Mosberger" }";
  
interpolation' = 
  let someName = "Silvan";
  in "Hello, ${ someName } Mosberger";
```
