So debugging closure sizes, let's go share my terminal, all right. So we're going to nix packages, and 
well, let's try to find something that might be a little bit big, let's do:

```
rg disallowedRefe
```

Okay, that's a good clue, so `disallowedReferences`, that's a way of saying to nix that do not allow this
package to end up in the result. Oh, yeah, there was a tool here to make graphs here, I don't know how
to run that, but so let's for example look at this one:

```
nvim pkgs/development/compilers/openjdk/generic.nix
/disallowed
```

```nix
disallowedReferences = [ openjdk11 ];
```

> Note: currently(01/2025) it looks like this:

```nix
# TODO: The OpenJDK 8 derivation got this wrong.
  disallowedReferences = [
    (if atLeast11 then jdk-bootstrap' else jdk-bootstrap)
  ];
```

So in this build, `openjdk` it says `disallowedReferences = [ openjdk11 ];`. This means that if you build
this package and this derivation ends up in the result that is being built, it's gonna fail. This is a good
way of ensuring that once you made a build work without that output it's not gonna be accidentaly introduced
afterwards.

And we can try simulating this fairly easily here, let's do, `postFix` up at the end we accidentally do 
something like this where we do `mkdir -p $out/something`, and we do `ln -s ${openjdk11}`, this might end
up like this because of the build, the make file somehow propagating this, we're gonna link this to
`ln -s ${openjdk11} $out/something/openjdk`, all right:

```nix
# Add the local library paths to remove dependencies on the bootstrap
    for output in $(getAllOutputNames); do
      if [ "$output" = debug ]; then continue; fi
      OUTPUTDIR=$(eval echo \$$output)
      BINLIBS=$(find $OUTPUTDIR/bin/ -type f; find $OUTPUTDIR -name \*.so\*)
      echo "$BINLIBS" | while read i; do
        patchelf --set-rpath "$LIBDIRS:$(patchelf --print-rpath "$i")" "$i" || true
        patchelf --shrink-rpath "$i" || true
      done
    done

  mkdir -p $out/something
  ln -s ${openjdk11} $out/something/openjdk
  '';

  # TODO: The OpenJDK 8 derivation got this wrong.
  disallowedReferences = [
    (if atLeast11 then jdk-bootstrap' else jdk-bootstrap)
  ];
```

And now we just need to figure out how to build this, actually I'm a bit surprised this is openjdk12,
openjdk11 is mentioned here, I guess 12 might be built with 11 (`openjdk11`), yeah, all right, so let's
build openjdk12:

```nix
❯ nix-build -A openjdk 
openjdk              openjdk11_headless   openjdk17_headless   openjdk20            openjdk21_headless   openjdk23            openjdk8-bootstrap   
openjdk11            openjdk17            openjdk19            openjdk20_headless   openjdk22            openjdk23_headless   openjdk8_headless    
openjdk11-bootstrap  openjdk17-bootstrap  openjdk19_headless   openjdk21            openjdk22_headless   openjdk8             openjdk_headless  
```

There is no 12, it might be the default, is it?

```nix
❯ nix-instantiate --eval -A openjdk.version
"21.0.5+11"
```

It is not, well then, let me go to 11 instead, let's copy this out:

```
mkdir -p $out/something
ln -s ${openjdk11} $out/something/openjdk
```

```
vim pkgs/development/compilers/openjdk/11.nix
```

And we're just gonna put it here instead:

```nix
  mkdir -p $out/something
  ln -s ${openjdk11-bootstrap} $out/something/openjdk
'';

  disallowedReferences = [ openjdk11-bootstrap ];
```
