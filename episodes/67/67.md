all right hello and welcome to the next nix-hour

so as always (if you have an if) if you have an issue you want to be taken a looked at in a future nix-hour

you can open an issue in the nix-hour repository and uh we might get to that

for today we have an issue about language tooling

um well I changed the the title from origin from what it was originally

um but so yeah after you have a kind of fresh nixos installation how can you install

like languages toolkits in a nix way and how to get into like a development workflow

so yeah let's take a look at that today I have a kind of fresh VM here

and uh you can take a look at how that works uh afterwards in nix-hour repo

uh I'm always using this templates this VM temp template in here which is kind of a nice way to get things going

all right so um fresh nix we need a project to work on so let's create something very simple and actually maybe

I'll well I guess let's get into the hang of it slowly

um so because in this setup only the `/etc/nixos` directory is actually kind of shared and and committed into here

I would have to create the project in here maybe I'll actually change that

um let me actually exit this VM

I'm going to change this so that I can do it in other ways

yes so down here I have this chair so `/etc/nixos` is shared to the current directory maybe

I'll create like a let's create like a home directory so we're also going to share the home directory in there

so kind of like this um home slome and we mirror that into I think the user is called `me` so just `home.me`

and uh I hope that directory actually exists when I enter the VM

> [!NOTE]
>
> The following commands were all run in the VM

I guess we'll see so let me just rebuild that and see whether that works so yes

uh as a for a simple project I'm recently doing a lot of rust so I guess let's just do the rust but it will be similar for most

uh well similar kind of similar they differ a lot uh all the different languages but uh a lot of them are similar

let's try to run this again and let me go into this home directory currently it's empty let's see whether anything is being created in here

this should automatically go away I think

um or I might have just no it works

okay so let's see if I go in here

oh yeah okay we can see things are being created so anything I create in the home directory should also be persisted

so I'm just going to do a `prj` for project uh now to get started we could use a template there's also flake templates I like to do things a bit more from the ground up so

uh to get started I guess we want something like `cargo init` or `cabal init` for haskell

there's a lot of these init ones

um we don't have cargo yet though so I'm just going to use nix-shell to get that

I believe that should just be cargo

```console
$ nix-shell -p cargo
```

a good way to start

oh yes that is a good point I haven't shared the the screen yet

doesn't make a lot of sense to just look at my my webcam right

uh so right this is the repository

> shows https://github.com/tweag/nix-hour/tree/master/templates/vm

um and here can I can see some things um yeah so

let me just briefly recap here

so in this conf configuration here

I just added one of these extra `sharedDirectories` so my home gets mirrored to `/home/me`

```nix
# file: configuration.nix
@@ -165,6 +166,10 @@
       source = toString ./.;
       target = "/etc/nixos";
     };
+    sharedDirectories.home = {
+      source = toString ./home;
+      target = "/home/me";
+    };

     # Allows Nix commands to re-use and write to the host's store
     mountHostNixStore = true;
```

that's the home directory in here I created this project and I entered a `nix-shell` with cargo

> [!NOTE]

> The code samples for this nix-hour are over at https://github.com/tweag/nix-hour/tree/master/code/67

```bash
cd ~
mkdir prj
cd prj
```

```console
$ nix-shell -p cargo
... output ...
```

all right so we just want to create this a simple project

I'm going to do

```console
$ cargo init
    Creating binary (application) package
```

I guess application package that sounds good to me okay so we have Cargo.toml and let me just do like

```console
$ cargo build
   Compiling prj v0.1.0 (/home/me/prj)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.33s
```

to make sure it works

uh that seems to have worked so `cargo run`

```console
$ cargo run
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.08s
     Running `target/debug/prj`
Hello, world!
```

hello world, all right that sounds good

there's also some like if you depend on C stuff for rust it's a bit more complicated

I'm not going to get into that for now

uh but yeah so we don't have anything nix in here yet

uh so let's start with something so we need to somehow how get a nixpkgs in here

we could use one from the kind of impure environment but I that's generally considered bad practice

so I'm going to use `npins` here and I guess let me exit the nix shell and just add npins for now

```console
$ nix-shell -p cargo npins
```

until we have a dedicated nix shell I'm just going to use nix

well until we have a dedicated `shell.nix` or a shell environment

just going to do it like this

so npins I want to init

```console
$ npins init
[INFO ] Welcome to npins!
[INFO ] Creating `npins` directory
[INFO ] Writing default.nix
[INFO ] Writing initial sources.json with nixpkgs entry (need to fetch latest commit first)
[INFO ] Successfully written initial files to 'npins'.
```

I believe that gives me a nixpkgs by default which I can then import and a nice way to pin things

uh needs to fetch the latest commit I don't think it fetches

oh I guess it might fetch from `nixpkgs-unstable` the branch by default

```console
$ npins show
nixpkgs: (Nix channel)
    name: nixpkgs-unstable
    url: https://releases.nixos.org/nixpkgs/nixpkgs-24.05pre602818.c726225724e6/nixexprs.tar.xz
    hash: 0nv06nzrn451sj2g74m3w2k0wr09k6wqzbax70569zq88vr45b3q
```

look at that oh no it uses the `nixpkgs-unstable` channel so that comes with the some extra things as well

um okay so we need a `default.nix`

now kind of how I like to structure things is to it doesn't really matter how you do that exactly

you can also use flakes it's very similar as well

uh so I generally like to have a shell attribute in here which then contains something like `mkShell`.

```nix
# file: default.nix
{

  shell = pkgs.mkShell {
  };

}
```

don't have any of the variables in here yet but something like this

so once we have that well actually let's also add arguments up here so you might want to have

um I think it's good to have system in here so that uh we `flake` users can kind of customize this and and make sure it doesn't use any impurities

currentSystem like this

```nix
# file: default.nix
{
  system ? builtins.currentSystem,
}:
{

  shell = pkgs.mkShell {
  };

}
```

we also want the uh right the sources for from npins

I like doing this like this so sources equals import npins and pins is where it creates a `default.nix`

so you can import this directly

```nix
# file: default.nix
let
  sources = import ./npins;
in
{
  system ? builtins.currentSystem,
}:
# ...
```

and then I also like to have this in here so you can in easily override individual inputs

`nixpkgs ? sources.nixpkgs,`

and like this okay so we have nixpkgs uh to easily override

and this is also nice because it you can like very much kind of determine how the interface looks like

so also if you want something likeI don't know a `crossSystem` for example

you could just do that here and be like null by default but users could customize this

```nix
# ...
  nixpkgs ? sources.nixpkgs,
  crossSystem ? null, # this
}:
# ...
```

um yeah but we don't need that right now

uh yeah so uh then we need to import nixpkgs

really simple we do an import of the nixpkgs in here

```nix
# file: default.nix
# ...
{
  system ? builtins.currentSystem,
  nixpkgs ? sources.nixpkgs,
}:
let
  pkgs = import nixpkgs {
    inherit system;
    config = {};
    overlays = [];
  };
in
{
  shell = ...
}
```

now again this is a not a problem with flakes but in here for without flakes

we just need to make sure that our we don't depend on any impurities

so that's just overlays and config

I really wish there was a kind of pure import endpoint in nixpkgs so that these wouldn't always be required

uh but it's it's not a big problem to do that

okay and then shell so we have `pkgs` here that exists now

and we also want a build of the package

I believe in rust uh let's actually look at the nixpkgs manual here

> [!NOTE]
>
> At the time of this nix-hour episode
> the stable nixpkgs manual version was 24.05pre-git
>
> The nixpkgs manual stable url is https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/
> which will change for every nixos release
>
> To get the exact nixpkgs manual you can follow instructions from this wiki page https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Nixpkgs/Manual#older_versions_of_the_manual

and just see how rust packages are built in nixpkgs

and hopefully that's going to be a fairly easy thing

uh no not untrusted I let me go to the languages and Frameworks section here then have down here to rust

> visits https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#rust

um okay so they say `rustc`, `cargo`

okay uh there's this build platf `rustPlatform.buildRustPackage`, that sounds pretty good

um now we could do that in line here

uh we could do like this `rustPlatform.buildRustPackage`

```nix
# file: default.nix
# ...
{
  build = pkgs.rustPlatform.buildRustPackage {};

  shell = ...;
}
```

but I I kind of like doing that in separate files so it also mirrors the `callPackage` pattern in nixpkgs

has some other like minor benefits

so I'm going to do `callPackage`

```nix
# file: default.nix
# ...
{
  build = pkgs.callPackage ./package.nix {};

  shell = ...;
}
```

I'm going to call this `package.nix` I think that's a fairly a good way good good
file name for this

this also our `default.nix` file doesn't get too long

(and it's right)

we can kind of put abstractions into their own file so `package.nix` will be for everything relating to the build

so I'm just going to actually copy all of this for now although copy doesn't work in here

so maybe I should open this in Firefox within the VM we but anyways I guess I won't copy this for now

it should be it shouldn't be too hard

it's `rustPlatform` we're going to do `buildRustPackage`

all right uh now `pname`, `version` we don't need to specify those both

I'm just going to call it uh well actually `prj` or `hello` let's call it that

uh source is going to be our very own directory here

uh `cargoHash` we don't want to specify this ourselves

I believe there's also a way to just propagate the lock file generated by cargo yeah this here (in the nixpkgs manual https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#importing-a-cargo.lock-file)

all right let's copy this

`cargoLock.lockFile = ./Cargo.lock`

so this is very nice when the the kind of tooling for the language already generates a lock file like this

so you can in this case nix can reuse all of the hashes in there that that's not uh very usual

um okay so get the lock file do we need anything else what was up there yeah actually no I think that's it

meta is not a requirement for packages (that are) not inside nixpkgs

so this might just be like everything we need

```nix
# file: package.nix
{ rustPlatform }:
rustPlatform.buildRustPackage {
  name = "hello";

  src = ./.;
  cargoLock.lockFile = ./Cargo.lock;
}
```

so let me exit this

in our `default.nix` we have this build now

so actually let me just try doing that build

```console
$ nix-build -A build
... running in the foreground ...
```

see if that works it's it's going to have to build a lot of bunch of things, I'm going to imagine

oh it also has to fetch nixpkgs

I I wish there was like a like the the progress happened with all nix commands uh but it it's not too long

so that sounds good

`vendor-dir` I believe it builds first one derivation with all the dependencies

or it might fetch the dependencies in an initial derivation something like that

needing to download a bunch of things still though

okay meanwhile I guess we can take a look at um oh yeah so we want to use LSP or so LSP language server protocol

and for that we need a client and a server um

yeah okay that worked

```console
$ nix-build -A build
... builds successfully ...
```

let's just check it out in `./result/bin/prj`

```console
$ ./result/bin/prj
Hello, world!
```

all right hello world

that seems to work so we have a working nix build already

uh but we don't have the shell yet

we're still in this kind of nix-shell or or kind of manual nix-shell here

so to make that work we already have this kind of skeleton here

```nix
# file: default.nix
# ...
  shell = pkgs.mkShell {
  };
```

and now I just want to have a build environment for this derivation

and uh for that we can use actually let me look at the nixpkgs manual

> visits https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable

`mkShell` has a very nice attribute for that which allows you to get

to kind of propagate the input from other derivations

believe it's `inputsFrom` actually

yeah `mkShell` `inputsFrom` so let's do that

```nix
# file: default.nix
# ...
  shell = pkgs.mkShell {
    inputsFrom = [ build ];
  };
```

`inputsFrom` and so in here we want to get the build

but now this doesn't quite work because the

build is uh it's not in a

like we could do this `rec`

```nix
# file: default.nix
# ...
in
rec {
  build = pkgs.callPackage ./package.nix {};

  shell = pkgs.mkShell {
    inputsFrom = [ build ];
  };
}
```

uh we could also put move the build up here to get it in scope maybe let's do that okay

```nix
# file: default.nix
# ...
let
  pkgs = ...;
  build = pkgs.callPackage ./package.nix {};
in
{
  inherit build;

  shell = ...;
}
```

and um do we need anything else for now I think that's fine now

actually we do need one thing one other thing uh we can use packages here

that's the same as native build inputs but

uh kind of a a nicer name so packages that
just adds something to the environment

```nix
shell = pkgs.mkShell {
  inputsFrom = [ build ];
  packages = [
    npins
  ];
};
```

and in this case we want `npins`

because we use it to manage dependencies

all right and finally last thing

I have `direnv` do I have it installed already I think I do

so I just want to use `direnv` to enter the nix environment

> visits https://github.com/direnv/direnv

and if we look at the how that works here

I think it's just use oh

um I'm not going to look into the docs that closely actually for now

but it's just I need a `use nix` statement in a `.envrc` file

```console
$ echo 'use nix' > .envrc
direnv: error /home/me/prj/.envrc is blocked. Run `direnv allow` to approve its content
```

yeah now `direnv` says blocked run direnv allow to approve its contents

so let's do that

```console
$ direnv allow
direnv: loading ~/prj/.envrc
direnv: using nix
error: undefined variable 'npins'

       at /home/me/prj/default.nix:22:7:

           21|     packages = [
           22|       npins
             |       ^
           23|     ];
error: getting status of '/home/me/prj/.direnv/flake-profile.7248': No such file or directory
direnv: nix-direnv: renewed cache
direnv: export ~PATH ~XDG_DATA_DIRS
```

and that should automatically enter our shell when we enter the directory

uh let's quickly see

> countoren (yt live chat): how do you compare in terms of benefits and disadvantages of callPackage pattern versus function with default values

um so `callPackage`

uh so I guess so one thing `callPackage` gets you is is that you can override the inputs afterwards

so if you um like let's say we have

oh yeah I mean `rustPlatform` wa does that has does that have a different version (?)

uh maybe not

but `callPackage` adds an `override` attribute so you can later do something

like let's say build_v2 here you could say

`build.override` and then say rustPlatform equal something else

```nix
# file: default.nix
# ...
{
  inherit build;

  build_v2 = build.override { rustPlatform = ...; };

  shell = ...
}
```

this might be like separate rust version or something like that um

furthermore um I think that's that's really the main thing `callPackage` gets you

well also there's this thing

`build = pkgs.callPackage {  /* here */  };`

so this is kind of convenient if you want to change the defaults

I guess so often times you might have something like

uh let's say uh `enableTests` for example

by default they might be disabled `false` in here

```nix
# file: package.nix
{ rustPlatform, enableTests ? false }:
# ...
```

um okay then in the `default.nix` you might say build

well by default the tests are disabled but then I don't know in CI

you might be like Ci

build equals `build.override` enableTests equals true

```nix
# file: default.nix
# ...
{
  inherit build;

  ci-build = build.override { enableTests = true; };

  shell = ...
}
```

kind of like this

um

> countoren (yt live chat): it is possible to do it with functions too if you feed nixpkgs

uh yes indeed so if you

well in this case it's a local file so if we had like the

hello package for example and we want to do that

so we could do this

packages let's say like `myHello` we could do `pkgs.hello.override` then do like an `stdenv` override or something like that

```nix
# file: default.nix
# ...
let
  myHello = pkgs.hello.override { stdenv = ...; };
in
{
  inherit build;

  # ...
}
```

uh but we could also like like reach into `nixpkgs` and kind of redo this call

so we could do I guess like this

uh and we need the path to `nixpkgs` for that so it would be `nixpkgs +` then well

that's kind of the problem you need to know where the file is

and that's not like a stable API so it could just break it at some point

actually that has happened in the past with the move to `pkgs/by-name` so previously

I believe it was like in um

```nix
myHello = pkgs.callPackage (nixpkgs + "/pkgs/applications/misc/hello/default.nix") { };
```

`applications/misc/hello/default.nix` something like that

but now it's actually in `pkgs/by-name/he/hello/package.nix`

```nix
myHello = pkgs.callPackage (nixpkgs + "/pkgs/by-name/he/hello/package.nix") { };
```

so that might change and then you might have to adjust these and

if you wanted to use this

I mean there it you could also do like an import like this

```nix
myHello = import (nixpkgs + "/pkgs/by-name/he/hello/package.nix") pkgs;
```

and uh this doesn't quite work unfortunately because

in these definitions you have like you don't have a dot dot dot up here

```nix
# file: package.nix
{ rustPlatform, enableTests ? false, ... }: # HERE, if it is not present

# ... ommited ...
```

if you don't have a dot dot dot and you call it with more arguments than it expects then it will just complain that it was called with more arguments

um so you would have to like explicitly filter out the specific packages you want here

which is then pretty much what `callPackage` does already

um yeah so there's some some kind of tradeoffs here

> chat: I meant something like pkgs ? import nixpkgs

oh yeah uh that also works

uh one of the kind of disadvantages of doing that

so let's imagine we did that or like

let's say right in `package.nix` we had something like

let's comment this out

`# { rustPlatform, enableTests ? false }`

like pkgs import

```nix
# file: package.nix
{ pkgs ? import (
# { rustPlatform, enableTests ? false }
```

well I guess in this case we want want the the pinned import

so we could do import npins do nixpkgs and then uh well we need to specify this to to make it kind of pure

uh but that would then also work and then we could do like

`pkgs.rustPlatform`

```nix
# file: package.nix
{ pkgs ? import (import ./npins).nixpkgs { config = {}; overlays = []; }, }:
pkgs.rustPlatform.buildRustPackage {
```

um but problem here is that

like as soon as you need this kind of nix this nixpkgs version in another kind of instance

like let's say you have a second package in here so

let's do like

```console
$ cp package.nix package2.nix
$ vim package2.nix
```

uh then in here you have the kind of the dup the duplicate thing here

```nix
# file: package2.nix
{ pkgs ? import (import ./npins).nixpkgs { config = {}; overlays = []; }, }:
```

and if you change make any changes to this one it might not propagate to the other uh

which I mean might be something you want but generally you you want these to all be synchronized and only have a single nixpkgs version used

and so declaring this in a single place so

in our case the `default.nix` or the `flake.nix` anywhere

like in a central place, you can kind of branch out to all the individual files

and have this be the only entry point

and all of the individual packages would only be defined as like attributes uh in the main one

that generally I feel like that makes it easier to kind of manage uh and packages and and just nix code and just code in general I'd say

uh yes so uh let's quickly go back here

```console
$ rm package2.nix
```

```console
$ nvim package.nix
```

let me oh I can undo

um oh right uncomment this

so we'll use this approach here I'm also I don't want to I don't have anything with tests here so let's undo that

```nix
# file: package.nix
{ rustPlatform }:
rustPlatform.buildRustPackage {
# ...
```

uh this one as well I guess I could also commit that um into the nix-hour repo

but it's it's in the uh video history at least

so we get inputs from so we need to

uh right we have this failure here undefined variable `npins` need to fix that

`pkgs.npins` in this case

```nix
# file: default.nix
{
  inherit build;

  shell = pkgs.mkShell {
    inputsFrom = [ build ];
    packages = [
      pkgs.npins
    ];
  };
}
```

we could also put the shell in a separate file

and I guess actually oh yeah we we have a problem still here we haven't done that yet

so if you just use nix

```console
$
direnv: loading ~/prj/.envrc
direnv: using nix
error: '' needs to evaluate to a single derivation, but it evaluated to 2 derivations
error: getting status of '/home/me/prj/.direnv/flake-profile.7773': No such file or directory
direnv: nix-direnv: renewed cache
direnv: export ~PATH ~XDG_DATA_DIRS
```

yeah so okay a weird eror

I wish that was a bit better so this is not

I wish nix just kind of said that if you have a `default.nix` and a `shell` uh attribute defined in it just use that

uh but for now we need to just create this small `shell.nix`

and say actually do like an import of the `default.nix` we just use `./.` and don't pass any arguments and then just

access shell so that's going to make you very small kind of compatibility uh shim for that

```nix
# file: shell.nix
(import ./. { }).shell
```

it's now when we do

we get into `.envrc` it's actually doing the right thing here

```console
$
direnv: loading ~/prj/.envrc
direnv: using nix
[0/2 built, 4/66/76 copied (89.6/298.6 MiB), 18.5/71.6 MiB DL] fetching python3-3.11.8 from https://cache.nixos.org
... omitted successful output ...
```

um I'm a bit surprised to see nix like this progress bar being used uh but that's fine

> chat: nix build over package.nix works as well if it's just a function that is all

yeah um so right if you had all the defaults here

nix build over this would also work

I think it's a it's a bit of an anti-pattern because then you uh well I mean yeah you then need to provide default arguments here

and at that point you can risk having to duplicate all of these like nixpkgs and so on

```nix
# file: package.nix
{ rustPlatform ? (import nixpkgs /* ... */ }:
```

so I generally really prefer to have this single file and then you branch out with different attributes

```console
$ nix-build -A build
```

seems to make it I feel like that makes it uh a bit cleaner

um and it would be really nice if we had the convention that a `default.nix`

or maybe `default.nix` is kind of already used too much already but maybe that n could call `project.nix`

uh as the kind of entry point and so like in a single repository you could have well

I guess `project.nix` that would be kind of like `flake.nix` that's pretty much yeah I guess

that's pretty much what I'm I'm saying uh that's pretty good idea of flake

that like uh you have this `flake.nix` that is the kind of entry point to to your project

and also and this is something I really wish the that was just added to the standard CLI

that like if we do `nix-build` a in a subdirectory

```console
$ cd npins
$ nix-build -A build
```

it doesn't work because it defaults to the uh `default.nix` file in the current directory

and uh really I think it should do the kind of same thing

like searching up search for `flake.nix` a `project.nix` to uh

to call this and hopefully

the new CLI kind of evolves in that direction I feel like that would be a good end result

so anyways uh in here we have npins

- we finally have shell that gets entered automatically
- we have npins in here

`npins show` we can look at the dependencies we have

```console
$ npins show

```

uh we can do a `nix-build` okay

```console
$ nix-build -A build
... runs successfully ...
```

and uh yeah so now we want something a bit more tooling here

in particular

> confus (yt chat): headline: no. 1 flake critic re-invents flakes 😁

_laughs_ yep

> confus (yt chat): keeps on freezing after a while after once I catch up to live am I a YouTube ...

um I will...

I don't have any dropped frames on my side so it might be on your side but let's see if anyone else has that same problem

so what I want to do do here is get a setup to easily be able to edit these files

```console
$ vim src/main.rs
# no lsp when editing
```

So currently if we enter like this I mean this pretty pretty terrible experience

I want like syntax highlighting

well I guess we have syntax highlighting

but like aut completion stuff like that

so uh for that we need LSP or well LSP is one way to get it

and if we look for like `LSP rust` (on duckduckgo)

I'm not sure if that's yeah rust analyzer is the way to go

and so we can just add that to our environment here

```nix
# file: default.nix
# ...
{
  shell = pkgs.mkShell {
    inputsFrom = [ build ];
    packages = [
      pkgs.npins
      pkgs.rust-analyzer
    ];
  };
}
```

it's not going to work by default because that's just the server

so my recommendation is really to add the server part of the LSP which handles like the specific language integration

and um right very specific to the language to the developer environment

that's right uh okay so we add that here

should download and install that

and meanwhile the client so uh the client

that's the editor part the editor part should be installed in your like nixos system

or wherever you have your editor declared

so that's I mean everybody wants a different editor but everybody body wants the same uh kind of language server they have the same language integration for each specific project

so uh let's let's I guess let's see

```console
$ rust-analyzer --help
... help text ...
```

does `rust-analyzer` have anything to like debug or just kind of run it in here so we can see if it works uh maybe not so let's not worry about that

um for the LSP client I think we have neovim here

```console
$ which vim
/run/current-system/sw/bin/vim
```

well

```console
$ realpath $(which vim)
/nix/store/ldbd94n8yf519mgyaspkip23d3gmz5by-neovim-8.9.4/bin/nvim
```

(close this _closes old terminal window in host_)

yes so that's neovim

neovim has a buil in LSP client I haven't used that before

> duckduck go "neovim lsp client"
> visits https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html

I think we had that covered in the previous nix-hour actually

let me briefly look into that and maybe we can just reuse that

um let's go here code

> visits https://github.com/tweag/nix-hour/tree/master/code

like every time hope it works again let me know if doesn't and uh yeah I think it's just my computer just like running at a way lower frequency because of overheating or something like that

okay um let's see I had to kinda exit the VM in here

just going to restart it and hopefully it works this time

so I wanted to check for uh I wanted to check for the neovim thing we had earlier here

> goes to https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Atweag%2Fnix-hour%20nvim&type=code

lspconfig.lua

> goes to https://github.com/tweag/nix-hour/blob/f6fd95fa62d5e23fa19f0101894e52d825eb890b/code/29/lspconfig.lua#L24

uh so if you wanted kind of check how that was done you can just go back to `nix-hour` number 29

here we have a home manager configuration

> goes to https://github.com/tweag/nix-hour/blob/f6fd95fa62d5e23fa19f0101894e52d825eb890b/code/29/home.nix

I haven't set up home manager in here but I think it doesn't really matter what exactly use

so I'm just going to kind of copy this here

although I can't quite copy it (from host to vm)

well I guess I can copy it while I'm still in yeah

uh `module.nix` let's copy it in here

```nix
# file: module.nix
{
  programs.neovim = {
    enable = true;
    defaultEditor = true;
    viAlias = true;
    vimAlias = true;
    plugins = with pkgs.vimPlugins; [
      {
        plugin = nvim-lspconfig;
        type = "lua";
        config = builtins.readFile ./lspconfig.lua;
      }
    ];
    extraPackages = [
      pkgs.rnix-lsp
    ];
  };
}
```

all right

so uh we need `pkgs` for that in scope

I hope the home manager module is kind of the same as the `nixosModule`

I guess we can just double check briefly

so neovim

_seaches for "neovim" in configuration.nix in `nix-hour/code/67`_

yeah programs actually default we don't need the alias
we don't need these plugins

uh plugins nvim LSP config

okay and then we read that config file and then extra packages

`rnix-lsp` that sounds pretty good

```nix
# file: module.nix
{ pkgs, ... }: {
  programs.neovim = {
    plugins = with pkgs.vimPlugins; [
      {
        plugin = nvim-lspconfig;
        type = "lua";
        config = builtins.readFile ./lspconfig.lua;
      }
    ];
    extraPackages = [
      pkgs.rnix-lsp
    ];
  };
}
```

I'm just going to copy this file here (_copies lspconfig.lua from nix-hour/code/29 to local lspconfig.lua_)

and I'm going to have to probably going to struggle a bit with the key bindings because my Vim setup is completely different

uh but okay let's see how this works

so I need to rebuild the VM and then we're going to rebuild within the VM after that

all right nice so it seems to be working

and uh yeah I'm we're currently for those who aren't in the loop we're looking at kind of project

> opens https://github.com/tweag/nix-hour/issues/20

oh what why did this not oh right need to do this uh

```nix
# file: configuration.nix (in nix-hour repo)
# ...
  imports = [
    # ...
    ./module.nix
  ];
```

we're looking at kind of setting up a project developer environment and getting the tooling right and getting the nix setup to work

```console
$ nix-build -A vm.run
... omitted ...
error: The option `programs.neovim.extraPackages` does not exist. Definition values:
... omitted ...
```

yeah oh and we have that uh `programs.neovim.extraPackages`

Okay so that's a difference in the modules for home-manager and nixos

so let's just go to nixos here let's see how we can do it with uh neovim

uh we need to search for nixos options

> goes to https://search.nixos.org/options?sort=relevance&type=packages&query=neovim

and we want oh how does that work well edit

package, enable, configure

oh it might be this actually

> expands https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=24.11&show=programs.neovim.configure&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=neovim

`customRC` oh this is

can I get this bit bigger

I guess let's do this so `customRC` and we have `packages.myVimPackage`

and then uh you have this okay

I guess we can do that then `withNodeJs`, `withRuby` blah blah

runtime? what is that

> expands https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=24.11&show=programs.neovim.runtime&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=neovim

> Set of files that have to be linked in runtime.

I don't think we have that

so yeah just configure

I think the home-manager module here would be nicer

but uh let's let's do this for now

configure and so we have a `packages.myVimPackage` I think that's doesn't really matter what it is

and then `with pkgs.vimPlugins;` that's kind of the same and then we have start

`start` equals and I believe that's then the

`start = builtins.readFile ./lspconfig.lua;`

and opt manually loadable by calling pack (_reading from above link_)

okay we don't need any of that

uh we do need oh no start yeah no that's not right

the `customRC` should be up here yeah `customRC`

make this a bit bigger

RC that should be our file okay

`customRC = builtins.readFile ./lspconfig.lua;`

and then our package `start` here should be thing we need to load which is

`rnix-lsp`

so that's `pkgs.rnix-lsp`

`start = [ pkgs.rnix-lsp ];`

oh no that's that's not a Vim package this is vim package `nvim-lspconfig`

`start = [ nvim-lspconfig ];`

okay let's see then extra packages I don't think that exists either

so how does that work should we just add that I guess we can just add that to like `environment.systemPackages` not actually quite sure what that is used for

`environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.rnix-lsp ];`

Yuriy asked it in another nix-hour there.

can't quite remember what it what it was for maybe

let's check the search here since we're here anyways

> searches rnix-lsp in search.nixos.org

`rnix-lsp` oh that's yeah I I should read the name that's the language server

um part so actually we don't need that I don't think because we add that to the project directly

all right

um so let's maybe just try this

```nix
# file: module.nix
{ pkgs, ... }: {
  programs.neovim.configure = {
    customRC = builtins.readFile ./lspconfig.lua;
    packages.myVimPackage = with pkgs.vimPlugins; {
      start = [ nvim-lspconfig ];
    };
  };
}
```

uh let me build it down here okay

```console
$ nb -A vm.run # alias for nix-build
```

and then meanwhile maybe let's go here

and briefly read this

> visits https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html

and I think blah blah blah

nvim, neovim provides an lsp client, servers are provided by Third parties yep

configure it

use this minimal example I believe the other defaults there come from a kind of bigger default somewhere

not sure where that comes from

but yeah let's reorient ourselves a bit around here

```console
$ vim lspconfig.lua
```

what do we have? we have uh global mappings

we have `<space>e` for open floating

so I guess that's for like type uh type descriptions something like that

we have these `<space>q`

LspAttach blah

okay oh and here these are the interesting ones

declaration

oh this one uppercase `K`, `gi`

actually these are fairly similar to the ones I use, well somewhat

okay let's run the VM and I guess let me keep that open in the background so I have it as a reference

all right, should take.. any second now, here we go

let's hope our project is still in here.. should be

okay prj very good

```console
$ cd prj
direnv: loading ~/prj/.envrc
direnv: using nix
... freshly downloading every package ...
```

entering into our environment

oh and uh we should maybe just check whether it works in Vim or I guess let's just try opening a file see what what happens

um is there anything like Rust specific in here

ah there's something up here yeah rust-analyzer setup

we might have to enable that or we might see `:help lspconfig-setup`

oh and uh this is

why is it downloading so many things

oh I guess it uh the kind of nix store might have been cleared when exiting the VM that could have been it

yeah I don't think it persists that although I think it should actually persist that uh

anyways I can meanwhile probably open a separate window here and do Vim

```console
$ mvim
mvim: command not found
```

oh

```
$ vim
```

and just do like a `:help lspconfig-setup`

see do we need anything special here

> each configuration exposes setup

> `require'lspconfig'.clangd.setup{}`

oh `rnix.setup{}` so we have that already (in `lspconfig.lua`)

uh rnix although rnix is a parser right

oh yes maybe we should have added that in the end _laughs_

> `lspconfig-all` match the server name

okay so `{filetypes}`, `{autostart}`

I guess let's see let's see what happens if we just open the file here

```console
$ vim src/main.rs
```

I can't see anything happening so I guess (we need to man) we need to do something

so how do we do that uh good question

uh let's see here

> visits https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html

well maybe we just need to kinda uncomment some of the the other things

uh but I wonder if it's also described in here

name, root_dir

> check that server the server attached is attached to the buffer

wa let me yeah let me just do that maybe diagnostics
